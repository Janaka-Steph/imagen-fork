Mobile app UI screen generation - Clean screenshots filling the entire image.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- The screen content MUST fill the ENTIRE image from edge to edge
- NO background around the screen
- NO phone frame or device border
- NO margins or padding outside the UI
- The image IS the screen, nothing else

Perspective:
- Front view ONLY - straight-on, no angles
- No 3D perspective, no tilted views, no isometric

Dimensions:
- Smartphone screen proportions (approximately 9:19.5 ratio)
- Full screen visible, not cropped
- Screen edges = image edges

Content:
- Realistic UI elements (buttons, text, icons, images)
- Appropriate content density for mobile
- Touch-friendly sizing for interactive elements
- Clear visual hierarchy

Quality:
- Crisp, sharp rendering
- Consistent styling throughout
- Professional, production-ready appearance

The output should look like a screenshot taken directly from a phone - just the UI, nothing else.
